# Week 1

## Bioinformatics Subdivision

Main Sub-disciplines of Bioinformatics
* Sequence similarity analysis
* Phylogenetics
**Phylogenetics** is the area of bioinformatics focused on developing methods, tools, and databases that use sequence similarity to generate "trees" that describe and compare evolution across species.
* Gene prediction
* Genomics assembly and comparison
* Proteomics
* RNA structure target prediction
* Protein structure and modeling
* Gene expression analysis
* Regulation
* Systems biology
