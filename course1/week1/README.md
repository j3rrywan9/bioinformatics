# Week 1 - Molecular Biology Review and Introduction

## Origins

The term "Bioinformatics" was coined in 1970 by Ben Hesper and David Searles and they used the term to mean "the study of information processes in biotic systems".
Bioinformatics is the nexus of biology, computer science, and mathematics/statistics.

## Bioinformatics Subdivision

Main Sub-disciplines of Bioinformatics
* Sequence similarity analysis
* Phylogenetics

**Phylogenetics** is the area of bioinformatics focused on developing methods, tools, and databases that use sequence similarity to generate "trees" that describe and compare evolution across species.
* Gene prediction

**Gene prediction** is the area of bioinformatics focused on developing methods, tools, and databases for the identification of the protein coding sequences (a.k.a genes).
* Genomics assembly and comparison
* Proteomics
* RNA structure target prediction
* Protein structure and modeling
* Gene expression analysis
* Regulation
* Systems biology

## Three Domains of Life

For this class, it is more important to know that there are three Domains of Life: bacteria, archaea, and eukarya.

## Life's Major Molecules

### Nucleic Acids

### Proteins

### Lipids

### Carbohydrates
